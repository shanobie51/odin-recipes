    <h2>One Pot Lentils</h2>
    <p><h5>Healthy</h5><div class="text">- Lentils are loaded with immune-boosting <em>zinc</em>, <em>iron</em>, and <em>vitamin B6</em> (which creates infection-fighting white blood cells). These vitamins and minerals are essential for immune function. These beans are also spiced with both turmeric and cumin, which you guessed it, help boost the immune system.</div></p>
    <p><h5>Quick and Easy</h5><div class="text">- Lentils are a great meal to whip up when you don't want to spend all your time in the kitchen and would rather use your time doing other things. They are super easy to prepare, require very little cooking time, and since you throw everything into one pot, there is minimal clean up required. Plus, they are cheap. The perfect weeknight meal!</div></p>
